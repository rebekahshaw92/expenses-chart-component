### What I Learned

Before starting this project I have never working with charts before in HTML/CSS. I decied I would rather write my code using HTML/CSS and JavaScript instead of using a JavaScript library. I felt that not using a JavaScript library would give me the chance to learn more about JavaScript. 

While undertaking this project I learn how to use JavaScript script to fetch JSON file and loop through the data in order to create the chart.
